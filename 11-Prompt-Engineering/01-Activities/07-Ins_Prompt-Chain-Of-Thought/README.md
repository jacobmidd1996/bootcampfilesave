# Chain of Thought Prompting

**Chain of thought prompting** (also known as CoT prompting) is a technique that guides an AI model to generate a step-by-step reasoning process in order to generate the final response.

CoT is an extremely helpful prompting technique for enhancing the quality and accuracy of responses. CoT can also significantly reduce the risk of hallucination in the model. Hallucinations are a known issue with LLMs.

* A **hallucination** is a response generated by AI which contains false or misleading information presented as fact.

This technique requires the model to take a 'step-by-step' process in the instructions. It is best practice to ask the model to explain its reasoning in the output and to follow a specific format.

* Open [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in your browser.

* Enter the following prompt:

  ```text
  What is 48 divided by 4?
  ```

* ChatGPT will provide a response that may be similar to the following example:

  ```text
  48 divided by 4 is 12.
  ```

* In this simple example, it is easy to see that the answer is correct.

* Enter the following prompt:

  ```text
  Let's solve 48 divided by 4 step by step. First, we know that division is the process of finding how many times one number is contained within another. Here, we need to find how many times 4 is contained within 48. By performing the division, we get 12.
  ```

* In the prompt, we've included information about the steps to solve the problem.

* ChatGPT will respond in a similar way, including the steps it took to generate the response:

  ```text
  Exactly! You've broken down the division process step by step. Starting with understanding division as finding how many times one number fits into another, then applying it to 48 divided by 4, which equals 12. This approach helps ensure clarity and understanding of the division process.
  ```

* CoT prompting has a few benefits:

  * It can provide examples of how to solve the problem or similar problems.

  * It pushes the AI model to reason about the steps it takes to generate a response. Understanding these steps can help us evaluate the response.

* Let's try another example. Enter the following prompt:

  ```text
  Is it possible to have a square with a perimeter of 20 units? If so, what is the side length?
  ```

* Without CoT prompting, we'll get a response similar to the following:

  ```text
  Yes, side length is 5.
  ```

* To include CoT prompting, enter the following prompt:

  ```text
  Is it possible to have a square with a perimeter of 20 units. Explain your reasoning.
  ```

* Now, ChatGPT will include the steps it took to determine the answer, as shown in the following example:

  ```text
  Yes, it is possible to have a square with a perimeter of 20 units. Here's the reasoning:

  1. **Perimeter of a Square**: The perimeter \( P \) of a square is calculated as the sum of all its sides. If \( s \) represents the length of one side of the square, then \( P = 4s \).

  2. **Given Perimeter**: It is given that the perimeter of the square is 20 units. Therefore, we have:
    \[ 4s = 20 \]

  3. **Solving for \( s \)**:
    \[ s = \frac{20}{4} \]
    \[ s = 5 \]

  4. **Verification**: To ensure correctness, substitute \( s = 5 \) back into the perimeter formula:
    \[ P = 4 \times 5 \]
    \[ P = 20 \]

  5. **Conclusion**: Since all sides of the square are equal and each side measures 5 units, the perimeter of this square indeed equals 20 units.

  Therefore, a square with a perimeter of 20 units is possible, and each side of this square would measure 5 units.
  ```

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the benefits of CoT prompting?

  * üôã CoT prompting has a number of benefits, including the following:

    * It elicits enhanced clarity by having the AI model break down complex problems into understandable steps.

    * It improves the accuracy of the response and makes it easier to verify each step of the reasoning.

    * It's a great way to learn! The response is explaining the steps it took and the concepts it used to determine the answer.
