# Prompt Construction

Recall that a prompt is simply a set of natural language instructions for an AI model to perform a task.

When constructing a prompt, keep in mind that the response you receive can vary widely depending on the instructions you provide. Better prompts will lead to more accurate and relevant responses.

## Clarity and Specificity

Prompts should be precise and clear. Try to avoid ambiguity.

* Enter the following prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  Tell me about science.
  ```

* Explain that we can get a better response by making the prompt more precise and clear.

* Enter the following prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  Can you explain the theory of evolution by natural selection?
  ```

## Context and Detail

Providing context in the prompt helps the AI model understand what you are asking for.

* Enter the following prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  Tell me about Python.
  ```

* Explain that including more context in the prompt can make the response more relevant.

* Enter the following prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  Can you explain the basic syntax of the Python programming language for beginners?
  ```

## Open-Ended Versus Closed-Ended Prompts

We use open-ended prompts to get more detailed responses; whereas we use closed-ended prompts for specific answers.

* Enter the following open-ended prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  What are the benefits of renewable energy?
  ```

* With an open-ended prompt, the response is likely to provide more detail. This can be useful for topics we are interested in learning.

* Enter the following closed-ended prompt and demonstrate the response:

  ```text
  Is solar energy a renewable resource?
  ```

* A closed-ended prompt is useful for getting specific answers.

## Experimentation and Iteration

Don't be afraid to refine and iterate on your prompts. Experiment to see what works best.

* For example, you can start with a prompt similar to the following:

  ```text
  Tell me about AI.
  ```

* Based on the response you receive you can then refine your prompt:

  ```text
  Can you explain how neural networks work in artificial intelligence?
  ```

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answer (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is the prompt important?

  * üôã The prompt has a direct effect on the accuracy and relevance of the response. Better prompts provide better responses.
