# üìñ Code Generation Prompts

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use ChatGPT to generate example code and selectively integrate it into my application.

## Instructions

* Use a recursive algorithm to determine the element of the Fibonacci sequence.

* Carefully evaluate the generated code for its usefulness and suitability.

* Selectively integrate the generated code into a working TypeScript application.
