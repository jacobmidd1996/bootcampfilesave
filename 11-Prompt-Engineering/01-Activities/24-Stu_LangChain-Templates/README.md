## Instructions

* It's done when the OpenAI prompt makes use of a template to frame the translation response to Korean, French, Spanish, and German.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [LangChain Prompt Template](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start#what-is-a-prompt-template)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What benefits do we gain from preparing the language model prior to processing queries?
