# Prompt Recipes

* With our exploration of various types of prompts, certain structural patterns begin to emerge.

* Like source code, prompts lend themselves to reuse, for our own purposes as well as within the broader user community.

* Such reusable structures are known as "prompt recipes" or "prompt templates".

* We can leverage existing prompt recipes as a useful starting point for the creation of our own prompts.

* Open ChatGPT in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * Consider first the following prompt recipe:
  
    ```text
    Acting as a software architect, provide a list of optimization ideas to improve the performance of my application. Your suggestions should be targeted to software professionals. Do not provide detailed implementation plans, instead focus on the high level concepts.
    ```

    * We notice immediately that the prompt is nicely constructed and does a good job of providing context, both in terms of the role of the author and the target audience.

    * While the prompt may not be exactly what we need in some cases, we can however tailor it to our specific needs.

    * Suppose, for example, we are looking for user interface ideas for our product to present to the leaders of our corporation. We might modify the prompt as follows:

    ```text
    Acting as a software architect, provide a list of user interface ideas to improve the usability of my web application. Your suggestions should be targeted to corporation executives. Do not provide detailed implementation plans, instead focus on the high level concepts.
    ```

    * While the basic structure has remained the same, we have reused the spirit of the prompt and altered it to focus on user interface ideas and target an audience of corporation executives. Such is the intention of the prompt recipe.

* Prompt libraries are collections of reusable prompt recipes.

* We can use prompt libraries to access existing prompts, and to create and store prompts of our own.

* Open the [ChatX AI Prompt Marketplace](https://chatx.ai/marketplace/category/chatgpt/) in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * This site is just one of many examples of prompt libraries available on the web.

  * In many cases, prompt recipes are free, although some are available for purchase.

  * As with the previous example, it is typical to customize a reusable prompt in some way before putting it into use.
