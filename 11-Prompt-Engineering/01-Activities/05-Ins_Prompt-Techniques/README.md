# Prompt Techniques

Now that you have a better understanding of what prompt engineering is, we will explore some specific techniques that you can use to enhance your prompts.

The number of examples and level of detail of the input data included in the prompt can have a significant effect on the response. In prompt engineering there are specific terms to describe the number of data points provided.

## Zero-Shot Prompting

* **Zero-shot prompting** means that we are prompting the model without providing any examples. The AI model is relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response.

* Demonstrate zero-shot prompting by entering the following prompt:

  ```text
  Recommend a movie about a killer shark.
  ```

* We are asking the AI model to provide a recommendation without providing any examples of movies that we like or don't like.

* Zero-shot prompting is useful when seeking a broad output. Through the use of questions and answers with the algorithm, you can then guide it toward a more specific output if you so choose. Zero-shot prompting can also be a great tool when seeking a creative, out-of-the box output from the model.

## One-Shot Prompting

* **One-shot prompting** means that we are prompting the model and providing a single example.

* Demonstrate one-shot prompting by entering the following prompt:

  ```text
  Recommend a movie about a killer shark. I like Jaws.
  ```

* One-shot prompting can be useful when you are seeking to narrow down the response, but still want to give the model room to come up with potentially unpredictable outputs.

## Few-Shot Prompting

* **Few-shot prompting** means that we are prompting the model and providing multiple examples.

* Demonstrate few-shot prompting by entering the following prompt:

  ```text
  Recommend a movie about a killer shark. I like Jaws, The Shallows, and Open Water. I don't like the Sharknado movies or The Meg.
  ```

* With few-shot prompting, we can provide multiple examples&mdash;usually between two and five. This technique allows to focus the AI model and guide it to find more a specific response.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answer (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would we choose zero-shot prompting?

  * üôã We would choose zero-shot prompting when we want a general answer or we want the AI model to be more creative in its response.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would we choose few-shot prompting?

  * üôã When we are looking for a more specific answer, few-shot prompting may give us the best results. With few-shot prompting, we can provide multiple examples to help guide the AI model into focusing on a more relevant response.
