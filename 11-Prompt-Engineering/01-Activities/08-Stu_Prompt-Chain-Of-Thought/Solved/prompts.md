```

* Response:

```text
George starts with 8 slices of pizza. He eats 3 slices, and his friend eats 2 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we can calculate it step by step:

1. **Total Slices**: George starts with 8 slices of pizza.

2. **Slices Eaten by George**: George eats 3 slices.

3. **Slices Eaten by Friend**: His friend eats 2 additional slices.

4. **Calculate Remaining Slices**:
   - Total slices eaten: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) slices.

5. **Subtract from Total**:
   - Remaining slices: \( 8 - 5 = 3 \) slices.

**Explanation**:
- Initially, there are 8 slices.
- George eats 3 slices, which reduces the total number of slices by 3.
- His friend then eats 2 more slices, further reducing the total slices eaten by a total of 5.
- Subtracting the total slices eaten (5) from the initial number of slices (8) gives us the remaining slices, which is 3.

**Conclusion**:
After George and his friend have eaten their slices, there are 3 slices of pizza left.
