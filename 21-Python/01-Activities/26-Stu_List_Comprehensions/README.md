# 🏗️ Implement List Comprehensions for a Guest List

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an event host, I want an easy way to print out a list of all of my guests and calculate the number of attendees.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `get_total_guests()` function includes a list comprehension that calculates the sum of the guests in each party (adults + children).

* It's done when the `get_total_guests()` function returns the sum of the list comprehension using the `sum()` function.

* It's done when the `get_guest_list()` function includes a list comprehension that combines the invitation name and family name separated by a space.

* It's done when the `get_guest_list()` function returns the guest list created by the list comprehension.

How do you structure a list comprehension? Where does the `for` loop go?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Is it possible to create other kinds of comprehensions in Python? Can you create dictionary comprehensions?
