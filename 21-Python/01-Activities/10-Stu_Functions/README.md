# üèóÔ∏è Implement a Python Function to Calculate a Loan Balance

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a loan recipient, I want to know what the balance of my loan will be in a given number of years.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `calculate_loan_balance()` function accepts the following parameters, in this order: `principal`, `monthly_payment` `annual_interest_rate`, `years`.

* It's done when the `calculate_loan_balance()` function uses the following default values: `monthly_payment=0`, `annual_interest_rate=5.99`, `years=1`.

* It's done when the `calculate_loan_balance()` returns the `principal` variable rounded to two decimal places.

* It's done when the main function uses `calculate_loan_balance()` to calculate the loan balance using the user inputs `principal` and `monthly_payment`.

* It's done when the main function uses `calculate_loan_balance()` to calculate the loan balance using the user inputs `principal` and `monthly_payment` as positional arguments and the user input `years` as a keyword argument.

* It's done when the main function uses `calculate_loan_balance()` to calculate the loan balance using the user inputs `principal`, `monthly_payment`, and `interest` as positional arguments.

* It's done when the main function uses `calculate_loan_balance()` to calculate the loan balance using the user inputs `principal`, `monthly_payment`, `interest`, and `years` as positional arguments.

## üí° Hints

What is the keyword used to define a function in Python?

What is the difference between optional, keyword, and positional arguments?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Can you write an additional function, or modify the calculate loan function, so that it only uses optional parameters?

* What is the LEGB rule for identifying an object by name? How are global scale and built-in objects defined?

* Read through [PEP 257 Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).
