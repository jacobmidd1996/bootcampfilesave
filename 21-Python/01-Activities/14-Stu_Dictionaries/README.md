# 🏗️ Implement Dictionary Features for a Shopping List

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As someone who likes to plan ahead, I want to be able to store information about what products I want to purchase, and the quantity I need to buy.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when an item and associated quantity are added to the `shopping_list` dictionary in the format `{item_name: quantity}` when the user adds an item and the item does not exist.

* It's done when a user adds an item to the list, and that item already exists, then the quantity is updated to add the new quantity to the existing quantity.

* It's done when a user removes an item from the list, and the item quantity is reduced if the input quantity is less than the existing quantity, or removed if the item exists in the list.

* It's done when the user input is stored in a dictionary and the dictionary is sent to the appropriate function using dictionary unpacking.

## 💡 Hints

How do you pass arguments to a function when they're stored as a dictionary?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Can you turn the shopping list dictionary into a nested dictionary where each key contains a dictionary with the keys "price" and "quantity"? Can you add a user input question for the price?

* How do you access nested dictionary values?
