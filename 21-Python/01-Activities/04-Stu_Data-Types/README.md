# üèóÔ∏è Perform Calculations from User Input

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a customer, I want to know the total price multiple quantities of the same product will cost me, inclusive of sales tax.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the user is asked the name of the product they are purchasing and the input value is stored in a variable called `product_name`.

* It's done when the user is asked the quantity of the product they are purchasing, the input value is converted to an integer, and stored in a variable called `product_quantity`.

* It's done when the user is asked the price of the product they are purchasing, the input value is converted to a float, and stored in a variable called `product_price`.

* It's done when the user is asked the tax rate of the product they are purchasing as a percentage, the input value is converted to a float, and stored in a variable called `tax_rate`.

* It's done when the `product_name` variable is used in the input questions that set the quantity, price, and tax rate.

* It's done when the total cost of the purchase is calculated by multiplying the quantity by the price and multiplied by 1 + the tax rate divided by 100, then rounded to two decimal places and saved in a variable called `total`.

* It's done when a summary of the purchase is printed to the screen in the format "`product_quantity` `product_name`(s) will cost $`total`"

## üí° Hints

How can we use variables combined with strings in the `input()` function, which accepts only one argument?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Can you add an input question that is converted to a Boolean data type? If so, what input value would set the variable to `False`?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
