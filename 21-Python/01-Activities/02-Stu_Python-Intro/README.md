# 📐 Add Comments to the Implementation of Python Code

Work with a partner to add comments predicting the purpose of each line of code found in [02-Stu_Python-Intro/Unsolved](./Unsolved/order.py).

## 📝 Notes

Review the PEP 8 style guide so that when you start writing your Python code, you can stick to the style conventions.

Refer to the documentation:

* [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Add a ruler to VS Code to visually mark the PEP 8 recommended maximum line length of 79 characters.

* Install a Python linter extension like [Flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) in VS Code.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
