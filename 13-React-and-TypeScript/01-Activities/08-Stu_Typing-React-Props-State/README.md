# üìñ Implement TypeScript React Properties and State

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a developer, I want to implement component properties and state into my TypeScript React application.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the application displays two different `Advertisement` components, each with the fields `companyName`, `productDescription`, and `price`.

* It's done when the `Calculator` component "Add" button correctly updates the displayed fields for `total` and `previousTotal`.

* Use the "TODO" comments in the following files to guide your implementation:

  * `./Unsolved/src/components/Calculator.tsx`

  * `./Unsolved/src/components/Advertisement.tsx`

  * `./Unsolved/src/App.tsx`

## üí° Hints

* What are two different ways to define types for React properties and state?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you've completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* How could we make some React component properties optional?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
