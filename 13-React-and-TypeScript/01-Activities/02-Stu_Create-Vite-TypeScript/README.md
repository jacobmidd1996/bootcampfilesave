# 📐 Create a TypeScript React App

## Before We Begin

As we learned in the last module, initializing a React application using `npm create vite@4.4.1` is fast and simple. This time, we'll use TypeScript instead of JavaScript as the "variant" (i.e. programming language).

## Instructions

To create a new TypeScript React application, use the following steps:

1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@4.4.1`.

    * 🔑 **Note**: This command will automatically create a subfolder to house your React application; you don't need to perform a `mkdir` command to create one manually.

2. Enter the desired name of your new project folder.

3. From the first list of options, select your framework for our activities in class. As before, we'll be using `React`.

4. From the second list of options, select your variant for our activities in class. This time, we'll be using `TypeScript`.

5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.

6. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to the provided URL to see your application running.

7. Separate your application's `Counter` functionality into its own component as follows:

    * Replace the `App.tsx` in your application with the file `./Unsolved/src/App.tsx`.

    * Copy the folder `./Unsolved/src/components` into your `src` folder.

8. Rerun the command `npm run dev` and navigate to the provided URL to see that your application is now running using a `Counter` component.

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the primary differences between using `vite` with JavaScript and using `vite` with TypeScript?
