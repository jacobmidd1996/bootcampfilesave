# üêõ Build Errors Due to Children Type

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I should see my TypeScript build complete without errors when I try to build.

## Expected Behavior

Running `npm run build` should show a successful build message:

```sh
vite v5.2.13 building for production...
‚úì 36 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.68 kB ‚îÇ gzip:  0.44 kB
dist/assets/index-Ipat19sz.css    0.09 kB ‚îÇ gzip:  0.10 kB
dist/assets/index-Bz02yVYj.js   145.29 kB ‚îÇ gzip: 46.89 kB
‚úì built in 597ms
```

## Actual Behavior

Running `npm run build` shows an error message that says the following:

```sh
src/App.tsx:29:16 - error TS2746: This JSX tag's 'children' prop expects a single child of type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>', but multiple children were provided.

29               <BookCard key={index} book={book}>
                  ~~~~~~~~

src/App.tsx:31:19 - error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>'.

31                   {book.pages - pageMin}
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  src/interfaces/PageDifferenceProps.tsx:3:3
    3   children: React.ReactElement;
        ~~~~~~~~
    The expected type comes from property 'children' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & PageDifferenceProps'


Found 2 errors in the same file, starting at: src/App.tsx:29
```

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Run `npm run build` in the terminal.

2. See an error mesage and an unsuccessful build.

## üí° Hints

How can you type React children to be more than just React elements?

How can you allow multiple children and not just one?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some other possible options we could use as React children values, and what are the benefits and pitfalls of each option?
