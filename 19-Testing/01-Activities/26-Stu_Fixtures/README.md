# 📖 Create tests using fixtures to create an E2E Test using Cypress

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a test that uses the `thoughts.json` file as a fixture to display those thought products and check whether those authors display on the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I use the `fixtures.json` file in the `showThoughts.cy.js` file to mock an API call that would display all thoughts from the database.

* It's done when my tests verify that the authors from the thought display on the screen.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Cypress Fixture Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture)

## 💡 Hints

* What can we use to verify some of the text displays on the screen using Cypress?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
