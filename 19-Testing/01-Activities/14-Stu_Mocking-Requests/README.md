# 📖 Implement Mocking with a Request using MSW

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, when I run the application tests, they should pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when running `npm run test` results in tests that pass.

* It's done when the mocked requests also work in the browser, when running the application using `npm run dev`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Getting Started with Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## 💡 Hints

* Make sure to export your handlers, as they are used to set up the test server and the browser server.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you use `msw` to mock GraphQL network requests?
