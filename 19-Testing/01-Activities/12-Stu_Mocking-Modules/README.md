# 🐛 Profile Card Tests Failing Because of Missing Mocks

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a developer, when I run the application tests, they should pass.

## Expected Behavior

Running `npm run test` should show two passing tests for the `ProfileCard` component.

## Actual Behavior

Running `npm run test` results in two failing tests.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

2. Run `npm run test` to run our tests.

3. Both tests fail.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the `vi.mock()` method to mock a module? Which object key represents the default export of a module?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between mocking and spying?
