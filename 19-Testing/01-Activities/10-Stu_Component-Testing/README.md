# 🏗️ Implement Tests to Ensure React Components Render Properly

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to check whether my components render properly, so that I can be confident when I ship the code for production.

Use the "TODO" comments in the `./Unsolved/src/tests` folder as your guide in making your code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have run `npm i -D @testing-library/react happy-dom vitest pretty @types/pretty @types/jest` inside the `Unsolved` folder.

* It's done when I have imported the files of the necessary components into `/src/tests/*.test.tsx`.

* It's done when I have completed the tests to check that each component has rendered properly on the page.

* It's done when I have created a test to see whether each component matches the snapshot.

## 💡 Hints

How can you use the official [Vitest docs on testing](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html) and [pretty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty) to assist with this exercise?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What types of web development pitfalls can you and your partner identify that could be avoided through testing?
