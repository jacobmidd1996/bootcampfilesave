# Module 19 Mini-Project: Word Guess

In this mini-project, you are given a fully functioning MERN-stack application that allows users to click on different letters to fill in the missing letters of a hidden word. The application contains all of its tests. You will need to use the "Red, Green, Refactor" method to add a new `Countdown` component.

## User Stories

Work with your group to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to see the hidden word on the page.

* As a user, I want to be able to click on a letter to make a guess.

* As a user, I want to see my guess replace blanks in the word and display a message that says "Correct!" if it's correct.

* As a user, I want to see a countdown display of how many guesses I have remaining.

* As a user, I want to see a message that says "Incorrect!" if I guess incorrectly.

* As a user, I want to see a **Win/Loss** screen that displays the solution and a **Play Again** button if I run out of guesses or complete the word.

## Acceptance Criteria

The mini-project is complete when the following criteria are met:

* The given tests pass.
