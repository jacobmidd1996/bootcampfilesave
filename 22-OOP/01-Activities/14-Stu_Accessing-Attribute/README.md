# üèóÔ∏è Simulate the Coin Toss

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a game designer of a two-person game, I want a program that automatically flips a coin to determine which user starts the game first.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a side up attribute is initialized to `None`.

* It's done when a `toss` method of the `CoinToss` class is created that simulates a coin toss.

* It's done when the `toss` method uses the `randint` function to select between "0" and "1". If the number is "0", the side up is set to "Heads". Otherwise, the side up is set to "Tails".

* It's done when a method to get the current side of the coin is created.

* It's done when the method that gets the current side of the coin is returned.

* It's done when the `toss` method on the `CoinToss` instance is called.

* It's done when a side of the coin is displayed.

* It's done when an `if-else` statement is created to determine if the user or the user's opponent starts first based on the user's input.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What does the `@property` decorator do in Python classes, and how does it help with encapsulating class attributes? Look up information online to understand its purpose and how it can be used to create read-only attributes in a class.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
