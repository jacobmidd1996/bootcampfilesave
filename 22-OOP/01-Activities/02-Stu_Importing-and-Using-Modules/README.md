# 🏗️ Generate Random Lottery Numbers

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a customer who likes to play the lottery, I'd like to create a function that generates five random lottery numbers between 1 and 64.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `randint()` function is imported from the `random` module.

* It's done when an empty list is created to store the lottery numbers.

* It's done when a `for` loop is used to iterate over the value passed to the `generate_lottery_numbers` function.

* It's done when a variable is assigned to the `randint()` function, and the `randint()` function contains the numbers `1` and `64`.

* It's done when a random lottery number is added to the empty list.

* It's done when the list of random numbers is returned to the function call and the list is printed.
