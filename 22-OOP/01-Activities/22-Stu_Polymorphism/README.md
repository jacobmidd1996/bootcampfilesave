# üèóÔ∏è Implement Polymorphism for Shopping Cart Items

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, when I add items to my shopping cart, I want to view the correct total price of all items in the shopping cart.

## Acceptance Criteria

The activity is complete when it meets the following criteria:

* The shopping cart can hold multiple items, each with its own method for calculating the total price.

* A `PhysicalItem` calculates the total price by adding a shipping fee to the base price.

* A `DigitalItem` calculates the total price as the base price, with no additional fees.

* A `GiftCard` calculates the total price by applying a discount to the base price.

## üí° Hints

* How can polymorphism be used to handle different item types in a single list?

* What method should be implemented for each item to ensure the correct total price is calculated?

* How can you ensure that each item type calculates its price in a way that is unique to that type?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you refactor the code to use a base class?
