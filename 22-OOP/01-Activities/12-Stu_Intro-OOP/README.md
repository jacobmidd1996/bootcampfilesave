# 🏗️  Add More Car Attributes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online car shopper, I want to be able to search for a car I want to purchase.

Work with a partner to add more car attributes to the `Car` class found in the [car_class.py](Unsolved/car_class.py) file. Then, create instance variables for the new attributes, prompt the user to enter the new car information, and print the details.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `__init__` method is created with five parameters: "make", "model", "body", "year", and "color".

* It's done when instance variables are created for each attribute.

* It's done when the user is asked to enter the car information.

* It's done when an instance of the `Car` class is created and the variables from the user are passed to the class.

* It's done when the user information is printed.

## 💡 Hints

Don't forget the `self` parameter in the `__init__()` method, and make sure the year is an integer.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the differences between public and private class methods? When would you use these types of methods?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
