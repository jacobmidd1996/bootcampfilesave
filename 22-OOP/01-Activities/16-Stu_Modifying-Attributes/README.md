# 📐 Adding Decorator Methods

Work with a partner to change the "getter" and "setter" methods to decorator methods and change the attributes from public to non-public in [16-Stu_Modifying-Attributes/Unsolved](./Unsolved/setter_getter_methods.py) without breaking the program.

## 📝 Notes

Run the [setter_getter_methods.py](./Unsolved/setter_getter_methods.py) program before you modify the class methods to make sure it is working correctly. After you change the "getter" and "setter" methods to decorator methods, run the program again to confirm the functionality is the same.

  * A single leading underscore, `_radius`.
  * A single trailing underscore, `class_`.
  * A double leading underscore, `__radius`.
